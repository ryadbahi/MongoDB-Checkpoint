# MongoDB-Checkpoint

 ## What You're Aiming For

In this checkpoint, the main idea is to manipulate MongoDB CRUD operations

   1. Create a database called "contact"
   2. Create a collection called "contactlist"
   3. Insert these documents  in "contactlist" :
        - Last name: Ben, First name: Moris, Email: ben@gmail.com, age:26
        - Last name: Kefi, First name: Seif, Email: kefi@gmail.com, age:15
        - Last name: Emilie, First name: brouge, Email: emilie.b@gmail.com, age:40
        - Last name: Alex, First name: brown, age: 4
        - Last name: Denzel, First name: Washington, age:3
